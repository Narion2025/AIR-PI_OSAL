# Product Vision

OSAL aims to become a privacy-first bridge between emotional insight and AI-driven applications. By translating user interactions into minimal marker packets and enriching them with cross-linked archetypal knowledge, the system enables new forms of adaptive learning, therapy and civic participation without exposing personal data.

The highest short-term value for users is achieved by completing the Heart-Beat sprint, which adds synergy vector calculations and prompt adaptation. This unlocks meaningful feedback loops from the captured markers to the language model responses.
