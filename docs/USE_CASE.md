# Technical Use Case: Emotional Feedback in a Learning App

This scenario illustrates how the first OSAL MVP components can be used in an educational context.

1. **Edge Marker Engine** captures text snippets from the learner and produces a `MarkerPacket` with detected emotions.
2. **OSAL Gateway** receives the packet via `/ingest`, attaches a consent capsule and applies differential privacy before queueing it in Redis.
3. **Heart API** (not yet implemented) will read packets from Redis, compute a synergy vector and adapt the prompts for the tutoring LLM.
4. The **Demo UI** displays a live radar chart showing the learner's current emotional state while streaming responses from the model.

This flow allows realâ€‘time adaptation of learning material without exposing raw user data, fulfilling the privacy requirements.
